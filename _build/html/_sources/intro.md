# Konnichiwa! ("Hello!" in Japanese) ðŸ‘‹
Hello! My name is **Wakana Morlan**, a San Francisco based Marketing Data Analyst. 

I have 13-plus years of experience in digital and traditional marketing. I am a mediator of data and marketing, bridging the gap of two domains. I am adept at deriving actionable insights and developing marketing performance measures based on executive experience in various marketing channels and industries (Education, Retail, B2C, and B2B Software). I know what decision-makers are looking for, and I know what data can help team members to improve day-to-day marketing performance because I've experienced both!
