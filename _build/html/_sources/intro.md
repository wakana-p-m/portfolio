# Konnichiwa! ("Hello!" in Japanese) ðŸ‘‹
Hello! My name is **Wakana Morlan**, a San Francisco based Marketing Data Analyst. 

I have 13-plus years of experience in digital and traditional marketing. I am a mediator of data and marketing, bridging the gap of two domains. I am adept at deriving actionable insights and developing marketing performance measures based on executive experience in various marketing channels and industries (Education, Retail, B2C, and B2B Software). I know what decision-makers are looking for, and I know what data can help team members to improve day-to-day marketing performance because I've experienced both!

Do you remember the movie [Moneyball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/) starring Brad Pitt? Nowadays, using data for sport is very normal, but Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane pioneered it. The movie taught me *"Data Win"*. You may not have enough budgets or 6-figure star employees. But if you can empower the team to use data to make better decisions, your odds of winning the competition would increase. That's what I do and am passionate about.
