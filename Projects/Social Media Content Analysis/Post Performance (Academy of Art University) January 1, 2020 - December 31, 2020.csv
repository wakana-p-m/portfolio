Here are some mistakes you might be making that could impair your education: 
‚Ä¢ Poor Time Management Skills üïí: Balancing multiple competing priorities like a job, family responsibilities, and the demands of an online art degree program are never easy. Reminding yourself that this situation is temporary and that your perseverance will pay off later can help you juggle priorities and make the necessary short-term sacrifices.
‚Ä¢ Underestimating Online Education üíª: Online classes are not easier than in-person classes. Online students need even more commitment and self-motivation to study and complete their assignments. Make sure you are motivating yourself to put in the time and effort to each of your classes. 
‚Ä¢ Not Having Access to the Right Technology to Complete Course Requirements üéß: You must have the right tools to succeed and online art school is no different. Check the course requirements, ensure you have fast internet and all the software programs you need to succeed BEFORE classes start. 
‚Ä¢ Not Establishing a Peer Network or Office Hours with Instructors üëã: Online students sometimes make the mistake of not connecting with other students and instructors nearly often enough. Make connections, attend instructor‚Äôs office hours and join #ArtU online communities as often as you can. 
‚Ä¢ Hesitating to Ask for Help When You Need It üòÖ: No one can read your mind and your instructors want you to succeed! There‚Äôs never a reason for feeling embarrassed about needing assistance, so please ask your instructors and even other students for help when you need it.

Thanks to technology, you can now earn an art and design degree from anywhere in the world. üíª
1. Make Sure You Have a Reliable Internet Connection: Taking online classes requires participation in a variety of interactive learning experiences such as listening to lectures and participating in class and group discussions. You will need a strong Internet connection and the right software and equipment to stay connected to your professors and classmates. 

2. Never Assume That Online Classes Are Easier Than In-Person Classes: School is school. Before submitting your registration, know that you will spend many hours each week attending your classes, and then completing the work required for them.

3. Adjust for the Time Difference and Get into a Routine Early: Make a plan if you are going to be experiencing a time difference from California. It is also important to consider if an asynchronous (aka recorded classes instead of live classes) would be a good choice for you. 

 
4. Engage in All Activities to Make the Most of Your Online College Experience: Commit to active participation with group discussions, group projects, and asking questions of your professors. You can even participate in extra-curricular activities as an international online student.

5. Introduce Yourself to Your Professors Before Online Classes Begin: College professors and instructors work with hundreds of online students every day. It‚Äôs a good idea to send an email to each professor before the start of a new semester to introduce yourself and state what you hope to learn in each class.

Those new to using online platforms for learning should consider these tips to make the best out of it.

1. Time management is important: With in-person obligations gone, you‚Äôll need to set up a schedule that works for you and stick with it. 
2. The same workload as an on-site class: Don‚Äôt be fooled, online classes aren‚Äôt the ‚Äúeasy route‚Äù so make sure you give yourself enough time to dedicate to each class. 
3. Interact with instructors and students online: There are real people behind that screen! Reach out, connect and get feedback as much as you‚Äôd like with your classmates and instructors. 
4. The amount of effort you put in will directly impact your performance: There‚Äôs no getting around, you still need to put in the work, and procrastination is no one‚Äôs friend. So, get to it. 
5. Your online exams will still be proctored: You read that right, folks!
6. You need to understand the technology: Ensure you have the right computer programs and set up to do your best. 
7. Real professors are teaching, and ready to answer questions: Your instructors are here to help you truly *learn* so ask for clarification when you need it. They want you to do your best!

The way you decorate your home, whether that‚Äôs a house, apartment, or dorm, can have a positive impact on the environment. Implementing one small change in your decor can make a big difference in the long run. Whether you‚Äôre interested in architecture or just love home d√©cor, the following ideas can help you get started on making your home greener. 

Go Vintage üï∂Ô∏è: Buying furniture and other decor items that are fresh from the factory contributes to pollution and other harmful environmental effects. When you‚Äôre decorating your home, look for secondhand or used furniture and home decor items instead. 

Plantsüå∑, Plantsüå∑, Plantsüå∑: One of the easiest yet most effective ways to make your home eco-friendlier is adding plants. Plants also improve the indoor air quality in your home by eliminating toxins, pollutants, and other harmful particles. 

Renewable Energyüí°: Lighting is something you can‚Äôt do without, but you can choose eco-friendly options for a greener home. Consider choosing solar-powered lights for your home, which use the sun‚Äôs energy rather than relying on energy from your local electric company. 

Home Decor with Ethically Sourced and Sustainable Materials ‚ú®: When you‚Äôre choosing furniture and other home decor items, make sure you‚Äôre looking at how they‚Äôre made and where they come from. Choosing decor items that are ethically sourced and sustainable might also help you save money through tax breaks. 

Repurpose Items ü™ë: Instead of buying new items you can give a wooden table a fresh coat of paint in a striking color for added visual appeal, for example. Repurposing can help you put your creative skills to use while also being eco-friendly. 

Choose Natural D√©cor üåÑ: Plants aren‚Äôt the only way to bring nature into your living space - you can also decorate your home with pieces of driftwood, leaves, branches, and other natural items from outdoors. 

Creating an eco-friendly environment starts from making small and implementable steps. 
If you‚Äôre interested in eco-friendly designs, send us a DM!

1. Take charge of the paper: Start by laying out a rectangle which will contain the entirety of the figure you are drawing. This will allow you to size the figure as you wish and lay out the composition on the page as you like.
2. Measure: There is something of a split amongst artists whether you should measure first before drawing or draw first before measuring. Whatever your preference, don‚Äôt skip this step, and make sure to get your ratios correct. Also, don‚Äôt get fixated on having fixed proportions; trust you what you see and that the proportions in front of your eyes are right.
3. Pay attention to your set-up: A successful life drawing is dependent on your ability to freely mark the paper. Prepare the space and the set-up you need. Some artists will have the best results by being free to move their entire arm, while others prefer to work close to the paper. It is critical to get the right height and incline for your easel so that you can focus on your work conveniently.
4. Warm up: Don‚Äôt try to jump right into a long drawing but do some fast sketches of a minute or so to get going. Figure drawing should be about freeing up movement, your line, and your drawing process.

BONUS TIPS to improve drawing the clothed figure try:

1. Practice: Set up a life drawing space with several different fabrics and draw the way they drape and fold. Adjust the lighting in order to study how shading works. Use the same medium you prefer to use for figure drawing. 
2. Look Around: Make a study of the way fabric naturally folds and is compressed. Look at the different shapes that are formed in the process.

‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
In the second of a three-part series, WWD looks at fashion school graduates in the U.S. who were forced to miss their commencement and graduate fashion show due to the global pandemic. While the school staff describe how they adjusted as a result, the graduates discuss their senior collections, what they hope for the future ‚Äî and how being adaptable is key. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚ÄúChallenges make us the people that we are. In a crazy way, I almost like a challenge because it makes success that much sweeter. It‚Äôs all about training your mind to block out the ‚Äòwhat ifs‚Äô and the ‚Äòfailures‚Äô that arise through this crazy time and focus on what we, as students, can achieve. Focus on being confident in who we are as artists and what we have to offer for the future.‚Äù ‚Äî Makayla Godden, BFA Fashion Textile Design ‚Å£@academy_of_art 2020‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£
‚Å£ ‚ÄúAs we come out from this pandemic, it‚Äôs clear that now more than ever, we as future designers in the fashion industry have to hold ourselves responsible for being creative while practicing sustainability,"" Verona Tu, @otiscollege class of 2020‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
‚ÄúI think the best way to get through this uncertainty is to keep an open mind. Yes, it‚Äôs a rough time for all of us in the industry, but if we take a step back and work together we can get through this. The fashion industry is ever-changing and now is the time to look at how everyone involved can make a difference. This is just one hurdle that myself and my peers will experience. And after, we will see that the world can take a better approach in a slower fashion ‚Äî along with taking life in a more positive direction and thinking about our family and friends more than our material possessions. Just keep your head up!‚Äù‚Äî Zachary Tatoczenko, fashion design senior, B.F.A. @kentstate‚Å£‚Å£

‚Ä¢ 
Installation art has many qualities. Installations are almost always 3-dimensional, occupying a part of the room or gallery where it has been installed. Other qualities include:
- Multimedia: Installations often consist of found objects, electric devices, paint, smells and sounds.
- Site-specific: These pieces of art are designed to fit within a specific space and cannot be moved without being changed for the environment. 
- Curated experience: Installations are a curated experience that vary from one viewing to another. What you experience in an installation is not what another person experiences in an installation. 
‚Ä¢ 
Installation art began well before the term was coined in the 1960‚Äôs, as some artists like Marcel Duchamp were moving in the direction of installation art before it ever became a recognized medium. Installation art began as a way for artists to expand the boundaries of what is considered ‚Äúart.‚Äù At the time, artists were quickly recognizing that art can be anything, anything at all, including a room or a physical space. Since then, installation art has captivated the world over. 
‚Ä¢ 
Since the early days of installation art, installations have become much more, encompassing light, sound, and other multi-media options. However, those who want to create installation art must first learn the basics of art and design and how to manipulate a variety of mediums. Creation of quality art requires true understanding of the principles of two-dimensional and three-dimensional design, and how they combine into one space.

With the greatest team work and the amazing Polaroid images from all our students and faculty.

The holidays are a time for connecting with those who mean the most to you as well as your community. Our tree consists of rainbow lights and Polaroid ornaments.  The photographs show students‚Äô families, friends, pets, etc. making physical contact, via a hug, kiss, high-five, etc.  The Polaroids are mounted in acrylic for added weight and protection from the elements.  Each Polaroid is also printed with the Academy's logo on the back.  The tree topper is a vintage camera with a light-up flash bulb.

San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square took on a festive air on Friday as it hosted an Academy of Art University Christmas tree design competition.

Fifteen trees were decorated by student finalists from nine different departments of the school.

The finalists were selected for their creative takes on the classic holiday tradition, and then judged on the criteria of department representation, selection and application of materials, and overall design.

The winner of the competition, announced today, came from the Photography Department.

The finalists' trees will be on display in Ghirardelli Square until Dec. 31 as part of a special Christmas Tree Stroll through the square exhibit.
